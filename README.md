# Prey_Predator
Population dynamics for rabbits and foxes

## (a) A simple Lotka-Volterra Model

Lotka-Volterra model for predator-prey relationships could be described as following diff equation system:

```
$dN_{prey}/dt = R_{prey,o}N_{prey}(t) - \{lamda}N_{prey}(t)N_{pred}(t)$

$$MTF(f) = \frac{\pi\sqrt{2}}{2} \frac{M(f)}{M_0},    M(f) = \sqrt{SD_{gauge}^2-SD^2}$$
```
